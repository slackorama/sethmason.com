	<p>Did you know that you can navigate <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> search results with your keyboard? </p>

	<p>It&#8217;s a <a href="http://labs.google.com">Google Labs</a> experiment so you&#8217;ll have to enable it on any machine you want to try it.  </p>

	<p>To experience the glory of navigating search results with your keyboard, head on over to <a href="http://www.google.com/experimental/">Google Experimental Search</a> and click &quot;Join&quot; for the Keyboard Shortcuts experiment.  Then it&#8217;s simply a matter of pressing &quot;J&quot; to navigate down the search results and &quot;K&quot; to move up  your search results on Google.  Pressing &quot;O&quot; will then open up the link for you.  There are a few others that you might like as well so give this experiment a whirl.</p>

	<p>The keyboard shortcuts key will also show up on your search results page so that&#8217;ll help you remember them.  (Experienced <a href="http://www.vim.org">vi</a> users will of course recognize these keyboard shortcuts.)</p>
