	<p>Hello and welcome to sethmason.com.   This site is basically an experiment to set up a site that&#8217;s a resume of sorts.  It will feature articles about technology that reflect my depth of knowledge.</p>

	<p>The site itself is set up using <a href="http://textpattern.com" title="TextPattern - easy-to-use content management system for all kinds of websites">TextPattern</a>.  Normally, I would <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food" title="wikipedia definition for eat your own dogfood">eat my own dog food</a> and use a Java based content management system but I wanted to give <span class="caps">PHP</span> and Textile a test.  So far, I&#8217;m impressed.</p>

	<p>For more information about myself, check out my <a href="/about" title="about -- all about Seth Mason">about page</a>.  And feel free to leave a comment.</p>
