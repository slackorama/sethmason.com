	<p>I&#8217;m not a big fan of using the mouse.  It pains me to reach for it to accomplish something.  That&#8217;s why I was really excited to find the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/879">Mouseless Browsing</a> add-on for <a href="http://www.getfirefox.com">Firefox</a>.  </p>

	<p>From the add-on&#8217;s <a href="http://www.mouseless.de/index.php?/content/view/14/26/">homepage</a>:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>Mouseless Browsing (<span class="caps">MLB</span>) is a Firefox-Extension which enables you to browse the internet with the keyboard. The basic principle is to add small boxes with unique ids behind every link and/or form element. You just have to type in the id and press enter (there is also an automatice mode available) to trigger the corresponding action i.e. following a link, pressing a button or selecting a  textfield.</p>

	<p>I could never get <a href="http://w3m.sourceforge.net/">w3m</a> working how I liked it so Mouseless Browsing really scratches an itch I have.</p>
