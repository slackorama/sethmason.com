I love me some Intellij and I love me some Linux. Unfortunately, they
donâ€™t play too well together. Lots of keyboard shortcuts do operating
system commands.

For instance, `CTRL+ALT+L` reformats your code in Intellij but it never
gets a chance to that because that keyboard sequence locks the desktop
on Ubuntu. Besides changing quite a few keyboard shortcuts in the
administration screen, does anyone have any tips or tricks?
