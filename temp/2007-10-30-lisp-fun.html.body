	<p>Interested in learning <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_%28programming_language%29">Lisp</a>?  A new site has launched with screencast episodes about developing an application in Lisp.  The site is <a href="http://www.lispcast.com/">LispCast</a> and so far there are three videos up.  It&#8217;s about building a web application that is a clone of <a href="http://www.reddit.com">Reddit</a>.  The subject of the videos so far are writing it, developing tests and refactoring. They each clock in at about twenty minutes and are quite helpful.<br />It looks like the creator, one Eric Normand,  has some pretty big plans for the site.  Let&#8217;s hope that he is able to do it.  I know I&#8217;m rooting for him.</p>
