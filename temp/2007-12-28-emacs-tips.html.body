	<p>Since I&#8217;ve been programming more Perl than Java lately, I&#8217;ve started using emacs as my primary <span class="caps">IDE</span>.  Been checking out a few sites with tips and tricks to help me along the path of conversion from vi to emacs.  <a href="http://trey-jackson.blogspot.com/">Trey Jackson&#8217;s blog</a> seems pretty promising.  </p>

	<p>Hopefully, he can keep up the tip a week format.  Allegedly, he has 150 tips so he should be good for 3 or so years.</p>
