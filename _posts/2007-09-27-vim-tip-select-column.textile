<img src="http://sethmason.com/images/11.png" align="left"/> How many times have you wanted to replace a column of text with something.  With "vim":http://vim.org it's easy.  Just use <code>CTRL-V</code> to select a column using a visual block.

Once it's selected, you can do a search and replace, yank, cut and other actions.  For example, here's the keystrokes to change a column.
*  Put cursor and beginning of text to select
*  Press <code>CTRL-V</code> to begin select of the column
*  When you reach the end of your select, type '<code>c</code>'
*  Type the new text.  Note that this will only replace the first instance.
* Now hit <code><ESC><ESC></code>.  All the text has been changed!

The same thing works with plain old '<code>v</code>' (select character by character) and <code>SHIFT-V</code> (select by line).

Happy vimming!
