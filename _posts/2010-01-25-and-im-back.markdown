OK, so it's been over a year since [my last post](http://sethmason.com/2009/01/06/resolutions.html) (of which I completed all except two).  But here I am now with a wonderful new design, thanks to [Sprout Creative](http://www.sproutcreative.com) and a new outlook on blogging.

I've taken a bit of a different approach to blogging this time.  Instead of using a content management system like [Wordpress](http://www.wordpress.org) or [Movable Type](http://www.movabletype.com), I'm opting for static html.  The pages are generated by [Jekyll](http://wiki.github.com/mojombo/jekyll/) after being written in [GNU Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html).  I'm hoping that this tool set makes it easier for me to get posts up.  [Let me know](/contact.html) if you have any questions about the process or if you have any comments about the design.

We'll see if it sticks.  If you don't hear from me for another year, then you'll know that this little experiment failed.
