Do you use Subversion a lot from the command line in bash?  Then this tip is for you.  

Add the following to your .bashrc

{% highlight sh %}
# svn completion
_svn ()
{
    local cur prev
    COMPREPLY=()
    cur=${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD]}
    prev=${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD-1]}
    if [ $COMP_CWORD -eq 1 ] || [ "${prev:0:1}" = "-" ]; then
        COMPREPLY=( $( compgen -W 'add blame cat checkout cleanup commit copy \
        delete diff export help import info list lock log merge mkdir move \
        propdel propedit propget proplist propset resolved revert status \
        switch unlock update' $cur ))
    else
        COMPREPLY=( $( compgen -f $cur ))
    fi
    return 0
}
ccomplete -F _svn -o default -X '@(*/.svn|.svn)' svn
{% endhighlight %}

Save your .bashrc, source it (using <code>source .bashrc</code>) and now Subversion commands will complete.  For example, enter <code>svn upd</code> press the Tab key and you'll get <code>svn update</code>.

Think of all the keystrokes you'll be saving.

*Update:* I just found Subversion's own "bash completion script":http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/tools/client-side/bash_completion  which has a ton more options.  Mine is easier to maintain. :)
