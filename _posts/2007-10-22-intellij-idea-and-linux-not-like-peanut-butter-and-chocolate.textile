I love me some Intellij and I love me some Linux.  Unfortunately, they don't play too well together.  Lots of keyboard shortcuts do operating system commands.

For instance, <code>CTRL+ALT+L</code> reformats your code in Intellij but it never gets a chance to that because that keyboard sequence locks the desktop on Ubuntu.  Besides changing quite a few keyboard shortcuts in the administration screen, does anyone have any tips or tricks?
