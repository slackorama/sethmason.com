"svn log":http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn.ref.svn.c.log.html is a great command to see what's going on in your subversion repository.  Unfortunately, at my job we are using a really old version (1.1.4!),  a version so old that it doesn't support the @--limit@ argument.  This makes the @svn log@ painful to use as it outputs EVERYTHING.  

Luckily, @svn log@ is so awesome that it overcomes this weakness and allows you to use a date based criteria for listing log statements.  Unfortunately, the syntax is hard for me to remember.  Thus, I wrote this little shell script function that'll list activity for the given days in the past.  You can put it in your @.bashrc@ and run it like @svnlog 14@.  That'll output logs from the last 14 days.

{% highlight bash %}
svnlog() {
    OFFSET=$1
    shift
    svn log -r HEAD:{"`date -d "$OFFSET days ago" +%Y-%m-%d`"} $*
}
{% endhighlight %}
