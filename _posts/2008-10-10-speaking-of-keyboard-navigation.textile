Did you know that you can navigate "Google":http://www.google.com search results with your keyboard? 

It's a "Google Labs":http://labs.google.com experiment so you'll have to enable it on any machine you want to try it.  

To experience the glory of navigating search results with your keyboard, head on over to "Google Experimental Search":http://www.google.com/experimental/ and click &quot;Join&quot; for the Keyboard Shortcuts experiment.  Then it's simply a matter of pressing &quot;J&quot; to navigate down the search results and &quot;K&quot; to move up  your search results on Google.  Pressing &quot;O&quot; will then open up the link for you.  There are a few others that you might like as well so give this experiment a whirl.

The keyboard shortcuts key will also show up on your search results page so that'll help you remember them.  (Experienced "vi":http://www.vim.org users will of course recognize these keyboard shortcuts.)
