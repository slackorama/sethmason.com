Here's a helfpul tip if you use a couple of different machines and need specific things set up on a specific machine.

Just add the following to your ".bashrc":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash

{% highlight sh %}
## Read Generic RC                                                                            
for rcfile in "$HOME/.shell/"*.rc;
do                        
    if [ -r "$rcfile" ]; 
done
{% endhighlight %}

Thus, common things are stored in your .bashrc (like aliases, functions, etc.) and things you want on a specific machine are in their own directory.

Then, just put whatever machine specific files you want/need in ~/.shell and name them with .rc.  For instance, I have ~/.shell/smurf.rc that sets up some smurf information.

{% highlight sh %}
export FAVORITE_SMURF="Poppa Smurf"
export SMURF_LOVER=$HOME/bin/blue_love  

{% endhighlight %}

That way, if I ever need something that's specific to a machine, I just drop it in my .shell directory and away we go.
