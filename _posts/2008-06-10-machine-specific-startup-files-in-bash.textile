Here's a helfpul tip if you use a couple of different machines and need specific things set up on a specific machine.

Just add the following to your ".bashrc":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash

notextile. <pre class="code">
<span class="Comment">## Read Generic RC</span>                                                                            
<span class="Statement">for</span> rcfile <span class="Statement">in</span> <span class="Statement">&quot;</span><span class="PreProc">$HOME</span><span class="Constant">/.shell/</span><span class="Statement">&quot;</span>*.rc<span class="Statement">;</span>
<span class="Statement">do</span>                        
    <span class="Statement">if</span> <span class="Statement">[</span> <span class="Statement">-r</span> <span class="Statement">&quot;</span><span class="PreProc">$rcfile</span><span class="Statement">&quot;</span> <span class="Statement">]</span><span class="Statement">;</span> 
<span class="Statement">done</span>                        
</pre>

Thus, common things are stored in your .bashrc (like aliases, functions, etc.) and things you want on a specific machine are in their own directory.

Then, just put whatever machine specific files you want/need in ~/.shell and name them with .rc.  For instance, I have ~/.shell/smurf.rc that sets up some smurf information.

notextile. <pre class="code">
<span class="Statement">export</span> <span class="Identifier">FAVORITE_SMURF</span>=<span class="Special">"Poppa Smurf"</span>
<span class="Statement">export</span> <span class="Identifier">SMURF_LOVER</span>=<span class="Special">$HOME/bin/blue_love</span>  
</pre>

That way, if I ever need something that's specific to a machine, I just drop it in my .shell directory and away we go.
