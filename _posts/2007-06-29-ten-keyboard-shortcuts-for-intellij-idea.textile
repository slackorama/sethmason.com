For my "day job (IGN)":http://www.ign.com I use Java quite a bit.  And to edit I use "IntelliJ IDEA (The Most Intelligent Java IDE)":http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/.   I used to use "Eclipse":http://eclipse.org but work paid for an IntelliJ IDEA license and I've become hooked.  The refactorings and clean interface are a boon to my productivity.

Well this post isn't an IntelliJ IDEA fanboy post so let's get back on track.  Here's a list of shortcuts that I find most helpful for use with IntelliJ IDEA.  Note that these aren't the obvious ones (like *Alt-Space* for code completion).  These are some hidden ones that you might not know about it.

<dl>
<dt>*Ctrl-/*</dt><dd>Comment out the selected lines with //. </dd>
<dt>*Ctrl-D*</dt><dd>Copy the current line and paste it.</dd>
<dt>*Ctrl-Y*</dt><dd>Delete the current line.</dd>
<dt>*Ctrl-BACKSPACE*</dt><dd>Delete to word end from cursor.</dd>
<dt>*Ctrl-DEL*</dt><dd>Delete to word start from cursor.</dd>
<dt>*Ctrl-W*</dt><dd>Select the current word.  Press it again and it selects more of the code block.</dd>
<dt>*Shift+F10*</dt><dd>Run the configuration</dd>
<dt>*Shift+F9*</dt><dd>Debug the configuration</dd>
<dt>*Alt+F7*</dt><dd>Find usages of the current word</dd>
<dt>*Ctrl-J*</dt><dd>Bring up the "Live Template":http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/docs/help/editing/livetemplates/definetemplates.html context menu.  If you don't know about Live Templates, you can save major keystrokes by defining them.</dd>

For a complete list of keyboard shortcuts for IntelliJ IDEA, there's a "PDF (PDF of IntelliJ IDEA keyboard shortcuts)":http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/docs/IntelliJIDEA8_ReferenceCard.pdf issued by JetBrains floating around.
