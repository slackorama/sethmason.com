If you use the command line in bash, you should check out the CDPATH environment variable.  It'll make your life tons easier.

From the "bash man pages":http://www.linuxcommand.org/man_pages/bash1.html, CDPATH is defined as:

<blockquote>The search path for the cd command.  This is a colon-separated list  of directories in which the shell looks for destination directories specified by the cd command.  A sample value is ".:~:/usr".</blockquote>

In my .bashrc, I've got the following defined:
<code>
CDPATH='.:..:../..:~/projects'
</code>

This allows me to just type <code>cd app</code> when I want to go to <code>~/projects/app</code>.  Another great part of it is that if I am in <code>/var/log</code> and want to go to <code>/var/www</code> I only need to type <code>cd www</code>.  The <code>..</code> in the CDPATH takes care of finding it. 

The important part of it is the first one.  The single period allows for <code>cd</code> to work normally and find directories in your current directory.
