OK, I've fallen in love with putting my home directory in "Subversion (A version control system to rival CVS)":http://subversion.tigris.org/.   The benefits are enormous.  They include (but are not limited to):

* ease of setting up environment on new system
* backup
* ability to go "back in time" using Subversion "tags (Tags rule)":http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn.branchmerge.tags.html

Mind you I don't put everything in there, just the important stuff like my shell configuration files and my "vim (The one true editor)":http://www.vim.org configuration files.  Other important files  (like pictures and music I spent ages ripping) are backed up in other  ways.

Here's what I currently have saved in svn:

{% highlight bash %}
$ svn ls http://my.svn.server/svn/home-dir/trunk/
.Xdefaults
.antrc
.bash_profile
.bashrc
.dircolors
.inputrc
.irbrc
bin/
vim_local/
{% endhighlight %}

So now when I'm on a system, I'll have the same look and feel and same functionality as the utilities I use will be available in my @~/bin@ directory.

For those astute readers, you'll notice that I don't have a  .vimrc file in there.  That's because I'm using an excellent tip from Amir Salihefendic
about "taming your vim config":http://amix.dk/blog/viewEntry/162.  Basically on each system I have a specialized but simple .vimrc that sources the vim_local for what it needs.

I've found this setup works great on the many different systems I use throughout a given week (e.g. Windows, Mac and Linux).  And I'm safe in the knowledge that my configuration files won't disappear should my machines suddenly implode.
