I recently picked up O'Reilly's book
[97
Things Every Programmer Should Know: Collective Wisdom from the Experts](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596809484?ie=UTF8&tag=slackorama-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=05968094840) as it
was an eBook Deal of the Day. Overall, I thought it a great book for a
programmer just starting out in the field.  It had quite a few things that I
wish I'd known earlier.  Probably because I took an unconventional route to
programming.

One thing I found interesting was that many of the essays made reference to
the suggestion from [The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to
Master](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/020161622X?ie=UTF8&tag=slackorama-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=020161622X)
to learn one new langauage every year.  The suggestion by itself wasn't
interesting.  I think many people have heard it.  The thing that intrigued me
about it was that &quot;The Pragmatic Programmer&quot; is published by
Addison-Wesley.  I don't think I've seen such overt references to other
publishers' books in a programming book before.

Kudos to you O'Reilly.
