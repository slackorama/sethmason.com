Hello and welcome to sethmason.com.   This site is basically an experiment to set up a site that's a resume of sorts.  It will feature articles about technology that reflect my depth of knowledge.

The site itself is set up using "TextPattern (TextPattern - easy-to-use content management system for all kinds of websites)":http://textpattern.com.  Normally, I would "eat my own dog food (wikipedia definition for eat your own dogfood)":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eat_one's_own_dog_food and use a Java based content management system but I wanted to give PHP and Textile a test.  So far, I'm impressed.

For more information about myself, check out my "about page (about -- all about Seth Mason)":/about.  And feel free to leave a comment.
