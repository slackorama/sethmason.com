Hi, my name is Seth Mason and this is my personal website.

I'm a Java Software Engineer but I also enjoy writing Perl, JavaScript, CSS
and HTML.  I'm also in the midst of learning Ruby.  If you have a question or
would like to see my resume, just email me at seth [at] sethmason[dot]com or
use my <a href="/contact" title="Contact page">contact page</a>.

I have worked for Experian Cheetahmail since December of 2007 but nothing on
this site is endorsed by them.
