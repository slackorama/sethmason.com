For my [day job](http://www.ign.com "IGN") I use Java quite a bit. And
to edit I use [IntelliJ
IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/ "The Most Intelligent Java IDE"). I
used to use [Eclipse](http://eclipse.org) but work paid for an IntelliJ
IDEA license and I've become hooked. The refactorings and clean
interface are a boon to my productivity.

Well this post isn't an IntelliJ IDEA fanboy post so let's get back on
track. Here's a list of shortcuts that I find most helpful for use with
IntelliJ IDEA. Note that these aren't the obvious ones (like
**Alt-Space** for code completion). These are some hidden ones that you
might not know about it.

**Ctrl-/**
:   Comment out the selected lines with //.

**Ctrl-D**
:   Copy the current line and paste it.

**Ctrl-Y**
:   Delete the current line.

**Ctrl-BACKSPACE**
:   Delete to word end from cursor.

**Ctrl-DEL**
:   Delete to word start from cursor.

**Ctrl-W**
:   Select the current word. Press it again and it selects more of the
    code block.

**Shift+F10**
:   Run the configuration

**Shift+F9**
:   Debug the configuration

**Alt+F7**
:   Find usages of the current word

**Ctrl-J**
:   Bring up the [Live
    Template](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/docs/help/editing/livetemplates/definetemplates.html)
    context menu. If you don't know about Live Templates, you can save
    major keystrokes by defining them.

For a complete list of keyboard shortcuts for IntelliJ IDEA, there's a
[PDF](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/docs/IntelliJIDEA8_ReferenceCard.pdf "PDF of IntelliJ IDEA keyboard shortcuts")
issued by JetBrains floating around.
