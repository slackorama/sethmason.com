Title: Just Cuz'
Tags: lisp

OK, I’ve decided that the next programming langauge I learn is Lisp. I
just love all the parenthesis I guess. An excellent [Lisp
tutorial](http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/) is Peter Siebel’s book
[Practical Common
Lisp](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPractical-Common-Lisp-Peter-Seibel%2Fdp%2F1590592395%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1190332229%26sr%3D8-1&tag=slackorama-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325).

Fun stuff.
