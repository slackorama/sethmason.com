Title: Books I Read in 2018
Tags: books
Category: reading

Going on nine years, here's my annual list of books I read. Like all the other
years, I didn't meet my goal of 53 books. I only managed 33 in 2018. So, it's
basically a repeat of 2017.

In my defense, I did ride my bike [quite a few
miles](https://2018.strava.com/en-us/video/4669fef90a5e01bb8f09c7941527d517933e7ff8).
Even more than 2017 so it's not déjà vu all over again.

Anyways, here is the list. Once again, I read a whole bunch of Harry Bosch. And
also a whole bunch of Stephen King.
