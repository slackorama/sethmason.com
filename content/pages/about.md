Hi, my name is Seth Mason and this is my personal website.

I'm a Software Engineer and I also enjoy writing Python, Perl, JavaScript, CSS
and HTML.  If you have a question or would like to see my resume, feel free to
drop me a line via my [contact]({filename}/pages/contact.md).

I have worked for EdgeCast Networks since July of 2011 but nothing on this site is endorsed by them.

<p>If you have a question or would like to see my resume, email me at <script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/var emailriddlerarray=[115,101,116,104,64,115,101,116,104,109,97,115,111,110,46,99,111,109];

var encryptedemail_id75='';

for (var i=0; i<emailriddlerarray.length; i++) {
    encryptedemail_id75+=String.fromCharCode(emailriddlerarray[i])
    }
    document.write('<a href="mailto:'+encryptedemail_id75+
    '?subject=Message from Sethmason.com" "title="Email for info">' +
    encryptedemail_id75 + '</a>');
