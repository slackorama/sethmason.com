Title: Yet another blogging engine

Since David Lynch can [revive Twin Peaks](http://variety.com/2014/tv/news/twin-peaks-revival-to-air-on-showtime-in-2016-1201322329/), I figure I can relaunch this
dormant blog. I've redone this site and ditched the old
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) static site generator and decided to try out a
different generator named [Pelican](http://getpelican.com) that's written in
Python.

I never bothered to learn Ruby so when I ran into trouble with Jekyll, getting
it fixed was painful (to me). To Ruby programmers, probably not so much. Since
I'm a Python programmer, hopefully I wont' have as much trouble when things go
off the rails. Har har...rails...ruby...get it?

Frankly, porting it over was kind of a pain in the arse. I had to jump through
a whole bunch of hoops with custom scripts and
[Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) (which is a pretty incredible
piece of software) but that's all for a different post.

Welcome to the new site. Sorry if I spammed your feed reader with all
my new article ids. Hope you still love me!

And I want some of that damn good pie.
