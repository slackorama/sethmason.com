Title: jQuery and Friendfeed experimentation
Tags: jquery, javascript, friendfeed

So, I created a little page that’ll dump out the last 30 items from my
[Friendfeed](http://friendfeed.com/slackorama) feed.

[jQuery](http://www.jquery.com) and [the Friendfeed
API](http://friendfeed.com/api/) make it incredibly easy. It only took
me about 15 minutes to get it working. The rest of the time was making
it ugly with my crazy design skills.

It’s over on my [vanity
site](http://www.slackorama.com/projects/friendfeed/jquery-test.html) if
you are curious to check it out.
