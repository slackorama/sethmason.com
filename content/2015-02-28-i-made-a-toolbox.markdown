So, I finally got around to making the toolbox from the 1940's from
[St. Roy Underhill](http://shopclass.popularwoodworking.com/p-877-the-woodwrights-shop-s21-ep03-toolbox-from-the-1940s.aspx).
Aside from making it a bit shorter (so it would fit in our storage), not
making the base of the tray out tomato cans and using metal corner bumpers,
I followed his directions to the letter. It was a fun project that I made
entirely out of hand tools. No electrons were harmed in making this toolbox.

I opted to use poplar that I picked up at the local big box store because all
the pine was knotty and crappy looking . All the hardware used on it, I got
from [Lee Valley](http://www.leevalley.com). Overall, I'm pretty happy with
the way it came out. And I got some nice compliements at
[Off the Saw](http://www.offthesaw.com) last week.

Learned a ton from this so that's good. For example, using a
[Stanley #78 Rabbet plane](http://www.supertool.com/StanleyBG/stan10.htm#num78)
is not as easy as it looks. I kept going cockeyed with it. Also, resawing a
3/4" piece of poplar that is 30" long is not something you can do unless you
have an afternoon free. Note to self: make a new friend who owns a bandsaw.

A corollary to this is that sharp tools are very important. The resawing
probably would have gone quicker if my rip saw was sharp. And I gouged the side
with my dull block plane.

Finally, I learned I *really* need to make a shooting board. All the cuts where I didn't use my
[Langdon mitre box](https://sites.google.com/site/langdonmitreboxes/), turned
out all squirrelly.

But when all is said and done, now I have a nice little toolbox to carry my
tools around the house.
