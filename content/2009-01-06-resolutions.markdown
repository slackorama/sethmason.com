Title: Resolutions
Tags: personal

I have been mulling these over for the past couple of days but I thought
I'd post them to the internets in hopes of injecting some accountability
into the whole morass.

-   Get knee fixed
-   Go on vacation somewhere besides San Francisco/Oakland or Rhode
    Island with wife and child
-   Take better photos
-   Bake cake for wife's birthday
-   Lay off the sugar and don't lay around as much (uhm, after I bake
    the cake)
-   Learn Clojure
-   Fix what ails desktop computer
-   Clean out top drawer of bureau
-   Rebalance 401K
-   Turn 40 (yeah, I'm old)
