Title: Books I Read in 2017
Tags: books
Category: reading

So I got tired of waiting around for Donald Trump to post his reading list of 2017 and decided to preempt him and post mine. I have a feeling his was just the outside of Happy Meals and gum wrappers anyways. Plus, this is the only post I make these days so I want to make sure and get it out of the way early in the year.

My goal was to read 52 books this year but probably spent too much time [riding my bike](https://2017.strava.com/en-us/videos/4669fef90a5e01bb8f09c7941527d517933e7ff8/). Maybe I'll do better next year.

Anyhow, highlights from this year were [American War](http://a.co/cIdhpJY). Not sure if it was a documentary or a sci-fi novel.

And [The Nix](http://a.co/4HdgiKF) was a really funny surreal satire on modern life. I enjoyed it a whole bunch.

If you want to be absolutely terrified, feel free to dive into [The Sixth Extinction](http://a.co/6a8mqHy).

If you are curious, I use
[a python script](https://gist.github.com/d879bafad762d1c2b2c3) to generate
the list of books. (You'll need your Goodreads key in order to use it.) Then I
just paste it into [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/).

You can see the other years [here]({tag}books). I've managed to do this for 8
years running. Hooray for narcissistic me!
