Title: Speaking of keyboard navigation....
Tags: google, ""

Did you know that you can navigate [Google](http://www.google.com)
search results with your keyboard?

It’s a [Google Labs](http://labs.google.com) experiment so you’ll have
to enable it on any machine you want to try it.

To experience the glory of navigating search results with your keyboard,
head on over to [Google Experimental
Search](http://www.google.com/experimental/) and click "Join" for the
Keyboard Shortcuts experiment. Then it’s simply a matter of pressing "J"
to navigate down the search results and "K" to move up your search
results on Google. Pressing "O" will then open up the link for you.
There are a few others that you might like as well so give this
experiment a whirl.

The keyboard shortcuts key will also show up on your search results page
so that’ll help you remember them. (Experienced [vi](http://www.vim.org)
users will of course recognize these keyboard shortcuts.)
