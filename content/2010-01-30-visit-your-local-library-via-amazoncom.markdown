I love reading.  It's how I get most my knowledge (or lack thereof).  And I
also really like [bookmarklets][0].  They make browsing the web much easier.

And I found this great bookmarklet that let's you find a book that you are
viewing on Amazon.com at your local library.  It's called [xISBN
Bookmarklet][1].  I just call it 'library lookup v2.'  It was inspired by Jon
Udell's [LibraryLookup](http://jonudell.net/LibraryLookupGenerator.html) which
I used to use so I just updated the version.

It's really easy to set up and use.  Set up is [covered on its page][1] under
&quot;Try xISBN Bookmarkets.&quot; One thing you'll need in advance is to know
the base URL of your library's catalog.  Mine is
[http://catalog.colapl.org](http://catalog.colapl.org) for example.

Using it is even eaiser.  You just look at a page on Amazon or Barnes and
Noble and click the bookmarklet.  Or if there's a [ISBN][3] on a page, you can just
select it and click the bookmarklet.  It'll take you to a page [like
this.][2]

Depending on your library, you could place a hold on it and then pick it up.
Remember, support your local library!
