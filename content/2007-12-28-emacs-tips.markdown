Title: Emacs Tips
Tags: emacs
Category: editor

Since I've been programming more Perl than Java lately, I've started
using Emacs as my primary IDE. Been checking out a few sites with tips
and tricks to help me along the path of conversion from vi to Emacs.
[Trey Jackson's blog](http://trey-jackson.blogspot.com/) seems pretty
promising.

Hopefully, he can keep up the tip a week format. Allegedly, he has 150
tips so he should be good for 3 or so years.
