Title: Books I Read in 2025
Tags: books
Category: reading

Well, it's been over two years since I last this generated this file so I had to
do some sleuthing to figure out how to do this. So that was fun. 

I'm so glad that I wrote docs about how I did this. &lt;/sarcasm>

But anyways, here's the paltry list of books that I read this year.

* [The Memory Police](https://openlibrary.org/isbn/1101870613) by Yōko Ogawa (5 stars).
* [Blue Nights](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL15933234W/Blue_nights?edition=key%3A/books/OL24839327M) by Joan Didion (4 stars).
* [Elsewhere](https://openlibrary.org/isbn/1250219612) by Alexis Schaitkin (3 stars).
* [My Life in France](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL1820659W/My_life_in_France?edition=key%3A/books/OL23274915M) by Julia Child (4 stars).
* [Memory Piece](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL37622476W/Memory_Piece?edition=key%3A/books/OL51042138M) by Lisa Ko (3 stars).
* [Our Country Friends](https://openlibrary.org/isbn/1984855123) by Gary Shteyngart (4 stars).
* [Martyr!](https://openlibrary.org/isbn/0593537610) by Kaveh Akbar (4 stars).

* [The Russian Debutante's Handbook](https://openlibrary.org/books/OL28955096M/Russian_Debutante's_Handbook) by Gary Shteyngart (3 stars).
* [All Systems Red (The Murderbot Diaries, #1)](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL17914663W/All_Systems_Red?edition=key%3A/books/OL26500848M) by Martha Wells (4 stars).
* [James](https://openlibrary.org/isbn/0385550375) by Percival Everett (5 stars).

For the record (and by record I mean myself), here's how I generated this list (this year):

#### Export
First export books out of GoodReads using their [export functionaltiy](https://www.goodreads.com/import/review) to a csv.

### Duckdb to the rescue

Then I used the most excellet [duckdb](https://duckdb.org) to export the data to markdown format:

    :::bash
    duckdb <<'SQL' | pbcopy
    .mode list
    .headers off
    
    WITH cleaned AS (
      SELECT
        Title,
        Author,
        "My Rating",
        trim(
          replace(
            replace(ISBN, '="', ''),
            '"',
            ''
          )
        ) AS clean_isbn,
        "Date Read"
      FROM '~/Downloads/goodreads_library_export.csv'
    )
    SELECT
      '* [' || Title || '](' ||
      CASE
        WHEN clean_isbn IS NOT NULL AND clean_isbn <> '' THEN
          'https://openlibrary.org/isbn/' || clean_isbn
        ELSE
          'https://openlibrary.org/search?q=' ||
          replace(trim(Title || ' ' || Author), ' ', '+')
      END
      || ') by ' || Author || ' (' || "My Rating" || ' stars).'
    FROM cleaned
    WHERE "Date Read" >= '2025-01-01'
      AND "Date Read" < '2026-01-01'
    ORDER BY "Date Read" ASC;
    SQL

The damn robots helped me with some formatting issues because the data coming
out of GoodReads is utter crap.

You can see the other years [here]({tag}books) in case you missed them.
