Title: Books I Read in 2020

Adios 2020! You won't soon be forgotten, that's for sure. 

Aloha 2021! In the spirit of getting things off on the right foot, I'm posting the books I read right on time!

Only 17 books this year. Gonna blame too much binge watching of TV shows and a
lot of time [riding my bike](https://www.strava.com/athletes/16584859). I seem
to be rapidly falling away from my goal of reading 50 books a year.

Particular highlights were [The Water Dancer by Ta-Nehisi Coates][waterdancer],
[Nothing to See Here by Kevin Wilson][nothing] and [The Plot Against America by
Philip Roth][plot]. The Roth book was pretty frightening given current
cirumstances.

But let's not end on a bad note. Here's to a new year!
