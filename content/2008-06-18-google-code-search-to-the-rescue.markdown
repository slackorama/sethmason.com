Title: Google Code Search to the rescue
Tags: google, coding

**UPDATE:** Google Code Search was shutdown so this fun doesn't apply anymore.

Mmkay, this tip is probably a gazillion years late but [Google Code
Search](http://www.google.com/codesearch) is a great resource for a
budding developer. Heck, I'm a relatively seasoned developer and I use
it.

It allows you to search public source code using a variety of methods.
You can search for an exact string or a regex. You can search certain
files, certain packages and certain languages.

For instance, today I was curious how to use the Perl API for writing a
[Pidgin](http://www.pidgin.im) plugin as their documentation is a tad
sparce. A quick search looking for
[Purple::Find::buddy](http://www.google.com/codesearch?q=Purple%3A%3AFind%3A%3ABuddy&hl=en&btnG=Search+Code)
and I found a whole bunch of examples. You can also use it for silly
things, like looking for
[quotes](http://www.google.com/codesearch?hl=en&lr=&q=%22meaning+of+life%22&sbtn=Search)
from "Hitchiker's Guide To The Galaxy."

It's official, Google now owns me. *sigh*
