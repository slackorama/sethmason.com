Title: Books I Read in 2016
Tags: books
Category: reading

Ah nuts. It's been a whole year without a single post here. Anyways, at least
you get one post a year from me. That's more than some blogs I suppose.

Only 21 books this year! That's a grave offense. I must do better this year. Go
2017!

By far, the most terrifying (and timely) was "In the Garden of Beasts." Imagine
watching the rise of Hitler, screaming about it and no one does anything.
Imagine. It was much scarier than the Sarah Pinborough books.

Colson
Whitehead's
[book](https://www.amazon.com/Underground-Railroad-National-Winner-Oprahs-ebook/dp/B01A4ATV0A/ref=sr_1_sc_1) was
amazing. Heartbreaking and powerful all in one tiny book. Go read it now. I'll wait here until you get back.

And I cannot recommend reading
"[Weapons of Math Destruction](https://www.amazon.com/Weapons-Math-Destruction-Increases-Inequality/dp/0553418815/ref=sr_1_1)"
after watching "[Black Mirror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mirror)."
That will drive you towards a life of digital minimalism where you'll be handing
pieces of paper to people to securely deliver messages.

Without further ado, the books I read in 2016. See you next year (unless "Black
Mirror" sets you off):

If you are curious, I use
[a python script](https://gist.github.com/d879bafad762d1c2b2c3) to generate
the list of books. (You'll need your Goodreads key in order to use it.) Then I
just paste it into [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/).

You can see the other years [here]({tag}books). I've managed to do this for 7
years running. Hooray for narcissistic me!
