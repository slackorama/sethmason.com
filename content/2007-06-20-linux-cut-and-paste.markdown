Since I'm in the process of switching to [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/) I've
been hunting down tips and tricks. One great resource is the [Ubuntu
Blog](https://ubuntu.wordpress.com). Today they had a [great tip for
copying and pasting in
GNOME](https://ubuntu.wordpress.com/2006/12/12/cut-copy-paste-clipboard-management/).

Basically, what you do is highlight the text in one application (for
example Firefox), switch to another application and then click the
middle mouse button where you want the text to show up. Your highlighted
text is now exactly where you want it. If you don't feel like using the
mouse, you can use Shift+Insert in the second application to paste the
text.
