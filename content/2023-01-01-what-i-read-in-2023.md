Title: Books I Read in 2023
Tags: books
Category: reading

Well, here's my annual list of books I read. I hope you enjoy my occasional blogging.

Again with 19 books read in a year. At least I'm [consistent]({filename}2022-12-31-what-i-read-in-2022.md).

No promises I'll ever increase my blogging frequency any time soon, what with
all the [bicylce riding](https://www.strava.com/athletes/16584859) and [Instagramming](https://www.instagram.com/slackorama/).

Despite reports of its death, the Goodereads API still seems to be up and
running. While it could use some love (as could the site itself), I won't
complain as I can still pull this list pretty easily.
