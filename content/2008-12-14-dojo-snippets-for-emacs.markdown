Title: Dojo snippets for Emacs

I've been using [Dojo](http://www.dojotoolkit.org) for a couple of
months now and I really like it as it makes writing cross-browser
JavaScript a breeze.

I've also been using [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) with
[YASnippet](http://pluskid.lifegoo.com/upload/project/yasnippet/doc/index.html)
for a bit now too. YASnippet is a plugin for Emacs that allows you to
define a snippet that'll get transformed into something much bigger in
your file. It saves you a lot of typing as you can define areas in your
snippet where you get prompted to enter text and it'll autofill with
your entries. Very handy, let me tell you. There's a [screencast on
YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj7btx3ATg) showing how
powerful it is.

Which brings me to the point of this post. I've created a package of
snippets aimed at people writing Dojo based JavaScript. It's hosted up
on
[GitHub](http://www.github.com/slackorama/dojo-yasnippets/tree/master)
if you would like to use it. Currently, it only includes (what I feel to
be) the major functions but feel free to contact me if you'd like to add
more.
